# hello-world
class mandated!
Thanks for checking out my first Github project! This particular project is just for school,
but I'll be posting here more often in the near future. My handle is InfamousLombax, but you can call me
Zack if you prefer. I am trying to balance professionalism and privacy until the absolute last minute,
so please bear with me. I've really enjoyed coding these last few years, so I hope to begin my career
soon. We're gonna rule the world.
